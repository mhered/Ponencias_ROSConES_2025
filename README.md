# ROSCon Espa√±a 2025 ‚Äì Companion Repository

This repository collects the code, slides, and resources accompanying my two talks presented at **ROSCon Espa√±a 2025**:
* [Talk 1: ROS, LeRobot y un patito de goma ‚Äî Rob√≥tica e inteligencia artificial accesible]()
* [Talk 2: Sensores creativos mirando la pela]()

Both sessions were part of the *Education* track and focused on making robotics and AI more accessible, creative, and affordable.

## Talk 1: ROS, LeRobot y un patito de goma ‚Äî Rob√≥tica e inteligencia artificial accesible

üìç Barcelona, 5 November 2025 ‚Äî Track: Education

### Abstract

In this talk, we explore how far a 100 ‚Ç¨ open-source robotic arm (SOARM100) and a rubber duck can take us in the journey of learning about robotics.  
From basic direct control, through more advanced model-based traditional robotics using ROS2 control and perception pipelines and then on to novel data-based approaches using imitation learning with pre-trained LeRobot models, we demonstrate how a simple, affordable setup can be a powerful educational tool when we leverage open source libraries, the **ROS** ecosystem of tools and **LeRobot**, the open AI robotics framework from Hugging Face. 

A live demo was originally planned that could not fit in the shortened 20-minute slot, however all the materials and code used for the experiments are available here for the community to reproduce.

### Highlights

- Real ROS 2 integration with MoveIt, Gazebo Harmonic, RViz, and OpenCV
- Application of LeRobot models for imitation learning and teleoperation
- Open-source, accessible, and replicable hardware and software
- Educational and community-oriented approach derived from projects presented at PyCamp Espa√±a 2025 and PyConES 2025

### Requirements

- ROS 2 Jazzy
- MoveIt 2, Gazebo Harmonic, RViz
- Python 3.10+
- Optional: OpenCV, Hugging Face `lerobot` library

### Resources

- [About the talk](./patito/about.md)
- [Source code](./patito/code.md)
- [Notes](./patito/notes.md) including setup instructions to reproduce the demos and references and links to related projects and repositories
- [Slides](./patito/slides.md) used at ROSCon Espa√±a 2025

## Talk 2: Sensores creativos mirando la pela
üìç Barcelona, 5 November 2025 ‚Äî Track: Education

### Abstract

 Who says robotics requires expensive sensors? This talk presents three real examples of creative, low-cost hardware integrations for ROS 2 robots ‚Äî designed to inspire experimentation, teaching, and rapid prototyping on a tight budget.

Three case studies are presented:

1. Low-cost camera: hacking a $4 AliExpress webcam for visual perception.
2. RGB-D sensor retrofit: repurposing a second-hand Kinect 360 into a functional 3D sensor. We look at the quick and dirty and also at a fancier version to indulge better integration in our robot. 
3. Tactile sensor: turning a kitchen sponge and fridge magnets into a haptic sensor.

Each project includes open-source code, step-by-step build instructions, and ROS 2 integration examples.
 Beyond the humor and DIY spirit, the message is serious: democratizing robotics starts with accessible, open tools.

### Highlights

- Full ROS 2 integration (drivers, nodes, and examples)
- Documented, reproducible hardware builds
- Ideal for educators, makers, and researchers with limited budgets
- Promotes creativity, sustainability, and fun in robotics

### Requirements

- ROS 2 Jazzy
- MoveIt 2, Gazebo Harmonic, RViz
- Python 3.10+
- Optional: OpenCV, Hugging Face `lerobot` library

### Resources

- [About the talk](./sensores/about.md)
- [Source code](./sensores/code.md)
- [Notes](./sensores/notes.md) including setup instructions to reproduce the demos and references and links to related projects and repositories
